# Python-Project-for-Data-Science-Stock-Market-Analysis
From the 5th course of IBM Professional Certificate

# Overview
In this project I will focus on an analysis of the stock market, extracting financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reporting from different sources using Python libraries and Webscraping from popular stocks. After collecting the data, I’m going to extract KPI’s and I will visualize the data in a Dashboard to find patterns and trends. I’m going to focus in the GameStop Tesla, Amazon and AMD stocks.
It’s my first time in this domain, so I’m excited to see how the area of finances is, although I know is only a glance of this vast domain.
At last, this project is base in the 5th course of the IBM Professional Certificate of Coursera.
